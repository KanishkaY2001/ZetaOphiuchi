# ZetaOphiuchi
This repository is dedicated to a passion project I undertook at UNSW where I created a website detailing the scientific journey of Zeta Ophiuchi, a runaway star in our galaxy.
The website uses __Wordpress__ CMS and utilizes the following plugins:
- __Webyx__: A plugin that enables vertical and horizontal scrolling as well as paralax effects.
- __Elementor__: A website builder plugin that enables drag-and-drop functionality for page components.

Currently, this project uses InfinityFree, a free hosting service that provides sufficient diskspace, bandwidth and domain hosting. My current plan enables the domain to remain active and reachable until June 2024.

If you are interested in space, stars or want to see how I've developed this website, feel free to check out my website!
You may find all relevant project files in the repository itself, exported using __WPVivid__.
